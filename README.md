Using Vue 3 text in div visible (not) visible,

I wanted to encourage myself to document some information in using Vue 3.

In this case, to use a click event directive to toggle a div text content as visible or not.

In addition, I like to keep the responsive part of the business correct.

The image was created with a screenshot of cell phone size.

I attached the two CSS properties for viewing the render.

The point to remember is that changes can take place on a page, and a larger font size might overflow the width definition of div property.

I have included the HTML source.
